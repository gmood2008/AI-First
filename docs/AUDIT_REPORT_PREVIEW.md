## Report Features

### 1. Professional Header
- AI-First Runtime branding

### 2. Summary Dashboard

Four key metrics displayed in a card layout:

| **Success** | 3 | Successfully completed operations |
| **Failed** | 1 | Operations that encountered errors |
| **Denied** | 1 | Operations blocked by security policy |

### 3. Detailed Audit Table

Each row contains:

- **Timestamp** - ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2026-01-22T00:09:15.123456")
- **User ID** - Identifier of the user who initiated the action
- **Capability ID** - The specific capability that was executed
- **Action Type** - "execute", "undo", "confirm", or "deny"
- **Status Badge** - Color-coded visual indicator:
  - 🟢 **Success** (green)
  - 🔴 **Failure** (red)
  - 🟡 **Denied** (yellow)
- **Side Effects** - Tags showing the operation's impact (e.g., "filesystem_write", "network_write")
- **Confirmation** - ⚠️ icon if the operation required user confirmation
- **Duration** - Execution time in milliseconds

### 4. Data Sanitization

Sensitive parameters are automatically redacted:

**Before:**
```json
{
  "channel": "#general",
  "message": "Hello, World!",
  "token": "xoxb-1234567890-abcdefghijk"
}
```

**After (in report):**
```json
{
  "channel": "#general",
  "message": "Hello, World!",
  "token": "***REDACTED***"
}
```

### 5. Responsive Design
