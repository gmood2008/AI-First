    This is not approved for stdlib registration due to dependency and security risks.

proposal:
  status: PROPOSED
  rationale: >
    Multimedia handling involves codecs/transcoding and potentially untrusted inputs.
    It must be executed via an isolated sidecar with strict allowlists and size limits.
  governance_requirements:
    - Must validate media type and enforce size caps before processing
    - Must forbid external URL fetching and remote downloads
    - Must run in isolated sidecar with timeout, CPU/memory caps
    - Must produce auditable artifacts with checksums
  integration_rules:
    - Not callable as a direct stdlib capability
    - Only callable as a workflow step under an ACTIVE pack and ACTIVE facade
