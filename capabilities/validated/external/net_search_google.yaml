proposal:
  status: PROPOSED
  rationale: >
    Web search is non-deterministic and may involve licensing constraints. Govern via sidecar and audit storage.
  governance_requirements:
    - Sidecar must enforce query logging, rate limits, and content filters
    - Output must include query, engine, retrieved_at, and per-result URL/title/snippet
    - All fetched result bodies must be stored to workspace when used for decisions
  integration_rules:
    - Not callable as a direct stdlib capability
    - Only callable as a workflow step under an ACTIVE pack
