    Proposal-only external capability for retrieving market and fundamentals data from Yahoo Finance.
    Must run as an isolated sidecar adapter and must not embed scraping logic directly into stdlib.
  tags:

    - finance
    - market-data
    - yahoo

adapter:
  type: http_api
  config:
    endpoint_url: http://127.0.0.1:8787/finance/yahoo
    method: GET
    auth_type: none
    timeout: 30.0

proposal:
  status: PROPOSED
  rationale: >
    Market data acquisition is network-dependent and non-deterministic. It must be governed as an external sidecar.
  governance_requirements:
    - Sidecar must enforce allowlisted destinations and strict timeouts
    - Response must include source metadata (provider, query, retrieved_at)
    - No credential leakage in logs; secrets must come from env vars
    - Output must be persisted to workspace for audit replay
  integration_rules:
    - Not callable as a direct stdlib capability
    - Only callable as a workflow step under an ACTIVE pack
