  description: >
    Proposal-only external capability for layout optimization. This is not approved for stdlib registration.
    Execution must be governed via Workflow+Pack+Facade and an isolated sidecar.

proposal:
  status: PROPOSED
  rationale: >
    Layout optimization is inherently heuristic and may require iterative adjustment.
    It must not be introduced as a deterministic stdlib OUTCOME_RENDERER.
  governance_requirements:
    - Must run in isolated sidecar with strict timeout and resource caps
    - Must not fetch external URLs
    - Must emit structured audit fields and deterministic input/output schema
    - Must provide a human-review checkpoint in workflow for high-impact changes
  integration_rules:
    - Not callable as a direct stdlib capability
    - Only callable as a workflow step under an ACTIVE pack and ACTIVE facade
