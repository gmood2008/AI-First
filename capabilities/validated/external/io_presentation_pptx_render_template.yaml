    Proposal-only external capability for PPTX template-based composition.
    This must not override the official io.presentation.pptx.render (artifact -> file) stdlib capability.

proposal:
  status: PROPOSED
  rationale: >
    Template composition expands the failure surface (layout engines, placeholder mapping, component embedding)
    and may require non-trivial dependencies. It must be governed as an external sidecar proposal first.
  governance_requirements:
    - Must run in isolated sidecar with strict timeout and resource caps
    - Must not fetch external URLs or remote templates
    - Template path must be workspace-boundary restricted and explicitly allowlisted
    - Output must be produced as an auditable artifact (file_path or base64 + checksum)
    - Must emit deterministic audit fields (template_id/hash, byte_size, checksum_sha256)
    - Must define a strict, non-prompted input schema (no free-text instruction)
  integration_rules:
    - Not callable as a direct stdlib capability
    - Only callable as a workflow step under an ACTIVE pack and ACTIVE facade
    - Official io.presentation.pptx.render remains the deterministic stdlib renderer
